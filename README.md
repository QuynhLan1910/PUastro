        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Founded in May 2025, our group brings together experts in theoretical physics to advance understanding of the universe's most profound phenomena. We collaborate internationally with observatories and consortia to push the boundaries of knowledge in astrophysics.</p>

        <h2>Research Areas</h2>
        <h3>Gravitational Waves</h3>
        <p>Our team contributes to the analysis and theoretical modeling of gravitational wave signals detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network. We also participate in the LISA consortium, preparing for space-based observations that will detect lower-frequency waves from supermassive black hole mergers and other cosmic events.</p>
        <h3>Cosmology</h3>
        <p>We investigate the large-scale structure of the universe, including models of cosmic inflation, dark matter, dark energy, and the cosmic microwave background. Our work integrates theoretical predictions with observational data to refine our understanding of the universe's evolution.</p>
